			I hope to put a few non-intrusive ads on the sidebar here. A small source of income will be a nice incentive to continue producing this page. The size is currently dynamic, but once I get an ad-source I will likely need to fix the size and make the main body react accordingly.

			<h2 class="sectionHead">Welcome</h2>
			<div class="content" id="welcome">
				A brief description of what this site is should go here. A link to the about page will be located here, and the potential for a video is definitely there. This should be a brief but comprehensive explaination of what the site is all about, and it's goals. "The generation of web-based arcade game through use of evolutionary algorithms."<br><br>

				This section is currently dynamically sized to the information inside it. I figure the information located here won't change much, so fitting it directly to the information should work best.

			<h2 class="sectionHead">News</h2>
			<div class="content" id="news">
				This section should house the first several lines of the latest blog post from the news/blog page. That page will have information on the latest developments for the site, where things are going, what's new, etc. In addition, to make it obvious that this is a preview, we should work on finding a "fade to grey" effect to put over the text, that gradually goes out toward the bottom. A link to the blog page should be apparent, where the latest post will be displayed.
				<br><br>
				This area is a static size. Since the length of the blog posts will change, and the fade out effect and "more" buttons should be present, the actual size of this box shouldn't change, while how much content that fits into it will vary.
